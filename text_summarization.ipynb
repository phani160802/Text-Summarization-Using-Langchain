    "People across the country, involved in government, political, and social activities, are dedicating their time to make the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ (Developed India Resolution Journey) successful. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate funds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have got it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As soon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence disappeared.\n",

Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a question from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and assured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work'),\n",

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others.

      "Kalam shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti, who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. He assures her that it's a thoughtful question and expresses his commitment to achieving this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker was asked by Anukriti why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020. The speaker appreciated the question, thought it was thoughtful, and assured Anukriti that her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering rural areas and villages to achieve India's development goals by 2020. The speaker highlights the aspirations of India's 540 million youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud nation, and encourages professionals to consider these aspirations in their work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares a personal experience from a visit to Nagaland, where they saw a village council functioning effectively with financial powers and making decisions for the village's development. However, they note that there is still a need for physical connectivity in the form of quality roads to enable the movement of products from villages to markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also highlights the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's \"Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas\" (PURA) complex, which aims to provide physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity to 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. The complex includes healthcare centers, education facilities, and vocational training centers, resulting in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes the importance of empowering rural areas and villages to achieve India's development goals and promotes initiatives that promote rural development, employment generation, and entrepreneurship.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban Rural Action) project in Thanjavur district, which has been successful in promoting sustainable economic development. The project has established level education and vocational training centers, generating employment and creating entrepreneurs. It has also developed 200 acres of wasteland into cultivable land, where villagers are engaged in agriculture, bio-mass power generation, food processing, and marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project has also collaborated with Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women and the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products. This has enhanced the innovative abilities of the villagers and enabled them to produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the need for more PURA projects across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, suggesting that 7000 such projects are required to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is sharing two enriching experiences. The first is from a visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they met over 6,000 farmers from various states and union territories. The farmers showed great interest in the different gardens, including Mughal Gardens, Herbal Gardens, and Bio-diesel Garden, and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasized the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources and improve economic conditions through the \"Seed to Food\" principle, empowering farmers to protect and nurture the land for a second green revolution. They expressed confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience is from a meeting with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person born without hands and legs, who was full of joy and confidence. Despite his physical limitations, he expressed gratitude to God, his parents, teachers, and others for giving him confidence, training, and help. He asked the speaker what they could do for him, and the speaker asked how he could help. Murthy replied that he would like to sing in front of the speaker, emphasizing that he didn't need anything from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is about two stories of overcoming challenges and giving back. The first story is about a person with a physical disability who, with the support of his parents, teachers, and mentors, discovered his talent for music and now wants to use his art to inspire others. The second story is about the resilience of the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were affected by a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite their losses, the villagers showed courage and determination, and were able to overcome the impact of the disaster with the help of the Army, Air Force, and state government. The speaker emphasizes the importance of partnership and the human spirit in overcoming adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a personal account of the speaker's experiences with courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and calamities. The speaker describes their visit to a village affected by an earthquake, where they saw children and villagers participating in relief operations alongside the Armed Forces, and witnessed the on-the-spot settlement of relief grants by the Chief Justice and State Government authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also shares a personal anecdote about their visit to Car Nicobar Islands in 2005, where they met Tribal Council Leaders and saw the unique way the islanders responded to the 2004 Tsunami, taking in the affected victims as their own children and displaying courage and resilience. The speaker composed a poem, \"Sea Waves\", which was sung by the villagers and reflected their determination to overcome the challenges they faced.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also touches on the importance of connectivity for societal transformation, mentioning the speaker's address to the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa, where they discussed issues related to Africa and the world. However, the majority of the speech focuses on the theme of courage and resilience in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network to connect all 53 African countries through a seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optic, and wireless network at an estimated cost of $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers in Africa. The pilot project has already been commissioned in Ethiopia, where Indian and Ethiopian universities are offering an MBA course to 34 students. Additionally, specialists from CARE Hospital are providing medical services remotely to patients in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights India's achievements and contributions in various fields. Specifically:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Telemedicine: The speaker mentions that India has been providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in Ethiopia's Black Lion Hospital in Cardiology and Radiology since 2006, connecting 53 African countries through the Pan African network.\n",
      "2. Defense: The speaker expresses pride in India's defense forces, citing personal experiences of visiting the Siachen Glacier, INS Sindhurakshak, and flying a Sukhoi-30 fighter. They highlight the bravery and commitment of soldiers, sailors, and air warriors who perform their duties beyond the call of duty.\n",
      "3. Youth movement: The speaker mentions interacting with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming youth into enlightened citizens through the Lead India 2020 Foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is summarizing their experience meeting a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are involved in a program called Lead India 2020, which aims to transform youth into enlightened citizens. The program, led by Dr. N.B. Sudershan, trains thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the district administration. The speaker highlights the positive impact of the training on the students, including increased self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and recognition of their duties towards the nation. The speaker also shares a personal story of a student leader who was able to inspire her father to quit smoking after participating in the program. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of empowering the youth through value-based education and leadership, citing the country's rich cultural diversity and tradition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural and civilizational heritage while pursuing economic growth. They note that the country has made significant progress in the last 60 years and has a strong workforce, particularly among its 540 million youth. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation by 2020 and encourages the youth to aim high, quoting a famous poem that suggests that anything their heart desires can come true.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then outlines five key goals for realizing the vision of a developed India by 2020:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reducing the rural-urban divide to a thin line\n",
      "2. Ensuring equitable distribution and access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. Creating a harmonious balance between agriculture, industry, and the service sector\n",
      "4. Providing education with a value system to all meritorious students, regardless of societal or economic background\n",
      "5. Becoming the best destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes the importance of collective effort and the potential for India to achieve great things through the hard work and dedication of its people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for an ideal nation that:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Attracts the most talented individuals from around the world\n",
      "* Provides top-notch healthcare to all citizens\n",
      "* Has a responsive, transparent, and corruption-free government\n",
      "* Eradicates poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children\n",
      "* Ensures none of its citizens feel alienated\n",
      "* Achieves sustainable growth and becomes prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expresses gratitude to the citizens for their love and support over the past five years.

      "As APJ Abdul Kalam concludes his 5-year tenure, he reflects on the lessons learned and the progress made. He emphasizes the importance of empowering villages, mobilizing rural talent, and accelerating development. Kalam highlights the value of partnership, courage, and connectivity for social transformation and defending the nation. He also underscores the significance of confidence, training, and help in overcoming challenges, citing his personal experience with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a musician born without hands and legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam stresses the importance of empowering villages, citing his visit to Nagaland's Khuza ma village as an example of successful village empowerment. He also showcases the success of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA) complex, which has led to large-scale employment generation, creation of entrepreneurs, and development of waste land into cultivable land.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President meets with over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories and is impressed by their enthusiasm and practical suggestions for improving agricultural production. He emphasizes the need to double agricultural production with reduced land, water, and manpower, and to improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle of \"Seed to Food\". Kalam believes that empowering farmers and agricultural scientists can increase the agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam also shares his experiences in overcoming the impact of disaster through partnership, highlighting his visits to Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating earthquake in 2005 and Chuckchucha village in Car Nicobar Islands after the Tsunami in 2004. He emphasizes the importance of community resilience, courage, and partnership in recovery efforts, citing the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders who took possession of affected victims as their own children, and the Tribal Council Leaders' courage in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Kalam proposes the concept of Pan African e-Network, a seamless and integrated network connecting 53 African countries, aiming to provide tele-education, tele-medicine, and tele-dictionary centers. He also shares the success of the pilot project in Ethiopia, which has already been commissioned, and the partnership with Indira Gandhi National Open University to provide MBA courses to Ethiopian students.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam highlights the Indian experience in bringing technology to people, citing the example of providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa, and the connection of Heads of State in all 53 countries through the Pan African network. He expresses pride in the nation's Defence Forces, para-military forces, and internal security forces for their bravery, commitment, and devotion to duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam emphasizes the importance of empowering youth, citing the Lead India 2020 Foundation's efforts to transform young citizens into enlightened individuals. He praises the foundation's work in training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, particularly in Medak district, which has led to visible changes in self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and recognition of duties towards the nation. Kalam believes that empowering the youth through value-based education and leadership is crucial in harnessing the power of the 540 million youth below the age of 25, which he considers the most powerful resource on earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Kalam reflects on the richness of Indian tradition and the efforts being taken by different agencies to empower the youth, citing the example of the Lead India 2020 Foundation. He believes that with the right initiatives and partnerships, India can achieve significant progress in rural development, agricultural growth, and disaster recovery, and that courage, community resilience, and technology are essential components of this vision.\n",
